    Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe

    This will be the ultimate challenge my artificial intellegiance against
    your brain. To pick your square use the grid below.
    

                    0|1|2
                    -----
                    3|4|5
                    -----
                    6|7|8
                    

    Good luck because you don't stand a chance. To win you need to get
    three squares in a row."""
